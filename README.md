# Classroom - OpenGL

This is a space tracking my progress through the Learn OpenGL tutorial located here:

https://learnopengl.com/

It may also be a base for me to experiment with other aspects of OpenGL.

Note: There is a lot of code replication in order to follow the tutorials in sequence and to keep each section in discrete parts.
